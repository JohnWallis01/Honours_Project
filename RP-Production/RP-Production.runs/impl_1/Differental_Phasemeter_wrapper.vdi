WARNING: [Opt 31-32] Removing redundant IBUF since it is not being driven by a top-level port. Differental_Phasemeter_i/DAC_Interface/clk_wiz_0/inst/clkin1_ibufg 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'Differental_Phasemeter_i/DAC_Interface/clk_wiz_0/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.
