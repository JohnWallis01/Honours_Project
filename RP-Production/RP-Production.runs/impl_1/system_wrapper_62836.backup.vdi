CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is system_i/Custom_System_0/Target_Signal_out[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: system_i/Custom_System_0/Target_Signal_out[0]_INST_0.

The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is system_i/Custom_System_0/Target_Signal_out[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: system_i/Custom_System_0/Target_Signal_out[0]_INST_0.

CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.
